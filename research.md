Brief intro or summary of your research here.

## Machine learning for Bayesian Inference

I am developing a new method to perform Bayesian inference using Gaussian Process Regression and active sampling to create a surrogate model of the posterior function. This method is particularly useful for slow likelihoods, such as those arising in cosmology and astrophysics.


## Cosmological simulations 

As part of the LISA Cosmology Working Group, I am developing a new simulation code to model the gravitational wave background from enhanced curvature perturbations arising during inflation. 

## Fast PTA inference

I recently started working on PTA data analysis as part of EPTA, where I am trying to speed up Bayesian inference for PTAs using the jax-enabled PTA likelihood from Discovery.
