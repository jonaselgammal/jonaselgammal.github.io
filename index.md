title: Hi, I'm Jonas El Gammal

Welcome to my personal webpage.

I'm a cosmologist/astrophysicist, currently as a postdoc at the University of Insubria in Como. My work can broadly be summarized as follows: I take slow-to-compute problems and make them fast.

Currently, I am working on three main topics::

1. **[Machine learning for Bayesian Inference](research.md#machine-learning-for-bayesian-inference)**: I am developing a new method to perform Bayesian inference using Gaussian Process Regression and active sampling to create a surrogate model of the posterior function. This method is particularly useful for slow likelihoods, such as those arising in cosmology and astrophysics.
2. **[Cosmological simulations](research.md#cosmological-simulations)**: As part of the LISA Cosmology Working Group, I am developing a new simulation code to model the gravitational wave background from enhanced curvature perturbations arising during inflation. 
3. **[Fast PTA inference](research.md#fast-pta-inference)**: I recently started working on Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data analysis as part of EPTA, where I am trying to speed up Bayesian inference for PTAs using the jax-enabled PTA likelihood from Discovery.
