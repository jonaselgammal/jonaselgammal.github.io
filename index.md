Welcome to my personal webpage.

I'm a cosmologist/astrophysicist, currently as a postdoc at the University of Insubria in Como, Italy. Before that I was a PhD student at the University of Stavanger in Norway (supervised by [Germano Nardini](https://www.uis.no/en/profile/germano-nardini)) and before that I studied at RWTH Aachen University in Germany. 

Most of the time I'm a pretty chill dude and I enjoy all kinds of outdoor and extreme sports, such as hiking, climbing, skiing, surfing, skydiving, you name it. I also love to travel and explore new places, especially in the mountains.

Work-wise, what I'm doing can broadly be summarised as: I take slow-to-compute problems and make them fast. For this, I'm using machine learning and differentiable programming to speed up Bayesian inference for cosmology and gravitational wave detection. I also work on cosmological simulations and data analysis for Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). I'm a member of the [LISA Consortium](https://www.lisamission.org), where I develop a simulation code to model the gravitational wave background from enhanced curvature perturbations arising during inflation and tools for accelerated Bayesian inference of astrophysical sources. I'm also part of a member of [EAS](https://eas.unige.ch) and [DPG](https://www.dpg-physik.de).

Currently, I am working on three main topics:

1. **[Machine learning for Bayesian Inference](research.md#machine-learning-for-bayesian-inference)**: I am developing [**GPry**](https://github.com/jonaselgammal/GPry), a new method to perform Bayesian inference using Gaussian Process Regression and active sampling to create a surrogate model of the posterior function. This method is particularly useful for slow likelihoods, such as those arising in cosmology and astrophysics.
2. **[Reconstructing Curvature Perturbations via SIGWs](research.md#reconstructing-curvature-perturbations-via-sigws)**: As part of the LISA Cosmology Working Group, I am developing [**SIGWAY**](https://github.com/jonaselgammal/SIGWAY), a simulation code to model the gravitational wave background from enhanced curvature perturbations arising during inflation. 
3. **[Fast PTA inference](research.md#fast-pta-inference)**: I recently started working on Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data analysis as part of EPTA, where I am trying to speed up Bayesian inference for PTAs using the jax-enabled PTA likelihood from [**Discovery**](https://github.com/nanograv/discovery).
