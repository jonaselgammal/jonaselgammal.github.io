## Theses

### PhD Thesis (2025)
**Cutting Edge Data Analysis for Gravitational Wave Detection with LISA**

This thesis presents novel methods for Bayesian inference and data analysis in the context of gravitational wave detection with the upcoming LISA mission. It includes four papers covering fast Bayesian inference using Gaussian Processes, parallelized acquisition for active learning, and methods for reconstructing primordial curvature perturbations.

### Master Thesis (2020)
**Accelerating Bayesian Inference of Expensive Likelihoods with Gaussian Processes**

This master thesis explores methods for speeding up Bayesian inference when dealing with computationally expensive likelihood functions by using Gaussian processes as surrogate models. It introduces novel acquisition functions and algorithms for taking advantage of speed hierarchies in likelihood evaluations.
